&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, authorities reported 2,009 new cases and 142 more deaths nationwide. New cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total more than 68,000 people have been infected in China, with the death toll standing at 1,665.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of China there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four people have died - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures China has taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus are starting to have an impact, Mi Feng, a spokesman at the National Health Commission, said on Sunday. On Saturday, World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Beijing’ response to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China has bought the world time. We don’t know how much time,” he said. “We’re encouraged that outside China, we have not yet seen widespread community transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is China coping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of millions of Chinese still face heavy restrictions on their day-to-day life as part of the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the disease, which causes a disease named Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the response has focused on the hard-hit province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where the outbreak began. The city is all but sealed off from the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had also been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of measures to contain the coronavirus, Beijing has ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.
In another development Chinese state media published a speech from earlier this month in which Chinese President Xi Jinping said he said he had given instructions on 7 January on containing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, local officials in the city of Wuhan were downplaying the severity of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would suggest senior leaders were aware of the potential dangers of the virus before the information was made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the government facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak, analysts suggest the disclosure is an attempt to show the party leadership acted decisively from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">China has announced a drop in new cases from the coronavirus outbreak for a third consecutive day.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/corona.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/corona.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">‘Technosignatures’ could help in search for alien life</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/alien%20life" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="'Technosignatures' could help in search for alien life" /><published>2020-02-16T12:08:19+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-16T12:08:19+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/aliens</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/alien%20life">&lt;p&gt;Have scientists finally found the key to discovering whether we are alone in the universe?
Scientists are developing techniques to detect signatures from space in their search for alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Very Large Array (VLA) telescope, at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NARO) site in Socorro, New Mexico, will be used to constantly seek evidence of technosignatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technosignature is a proxy for the existence of a technologically advanced, extraterrestrial civilisation, according to scientists at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include things such as the chemical composition of a planet’s atmosphere, laser emissions or structures orbiting stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VLA is a collection of 27 radio antennas - and one spare - which work together to effectively act as a single huge telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Diamond, president and chief executive of the SETI Institute, said: “Having access to the most sensitive radio telescope in the northern hemisphere for SETI observations is perhaps the most transformative opportunity yet in the history of SETI programmes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Tony Beasley, director of the NRAO, based in the US state of Virginia, said: “Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “As the VLA conducts its usual scientific observations, this new system will allow for an additional and important use for the data we’re already collecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As continuing discoveries show us that planets are very common components of the universe, and we are able to study the characteristics of those planets, it’s exciting that at the same time, technological advances are giving us the tools to greatly expand our search for signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We also look forward to the coming decade, when we hope to build a next-generation Very Large Array, which will be able to search a volume of the universe a thousand times larger than that accessible to current telescopes - making it the most powerful radio technosignature search machine humanity has ever constructed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists are also making computer models to simulate extraterrestrial environments, helping the search for life beyond the solar system and planets that can support future searches for habitable planets and life beyond the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria Meadows, principal investigator for Nasa’s virtual planetary laboratory at the University of Washington, said: “Upcoming telescopes in space and on the ground will have the capability to observe the atmospheres of Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby cool stars, so it’s important to understand how best to recognise signs of habitability and life on these planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These computer models will help us determine whether an observed planet is more or less likely to support life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new developments come after astronomers based in Canada detected radio signals from outer space that repeat at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series of fast radio bursts (FRBs) - short-lived pulses of radio waves that come from across the universe - were detected about once an hour for four days and then stopped, only to start up again 12 days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRBs are not in and of themselves unusual, but previous observations have shown them to be mostly emitted at random.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Have scientists finally found the key to discovering whether we are alone in the universe?

&lt;p&gt;AZ went into the game looking to bounce back after their shock KNVB Cup loss at home to NAC Breda in midweek.However, Arne Slot’s side were second best from the start and were unlucky not to be behind in the fourth minute when Noa Lang smashed the crossbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 25th minute, it was 1-0 for the Tukkers after Giorgi Aburjania’s free-kick left Marco Bizot with no chance. Five minutes later, it was 2-0 when Queensy Menig punished Teun Koomeiners for losing the ball in midfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half, AZ couldn’t mount a comeback as Twente comfortably saw out the victory. AZ must now recover ahead of their Europa League clash with LASK Linz on Thursday. Twente climbs to 12th.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">AZ Alkmaar’s title chances took a blow as they were defeated 2-0 at FC Twente.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/twente.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/twente.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Manchester City’s European ban: Will it compromise their rebuild?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mancity" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Manchester City's European ban: Will it compromise their rebuild?" /><published>2020-02-15T16:33:19+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-15T16:33:19+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mancity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mancity">&lt;p&gt;The immediate concern for Manchester City is missing out on Champions League football. A chance for a trophy. A chance for the trophy. The one that has eluded this club even as they have become four-time winners of the Premier League over the course of the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bigger significance of a prospective two-year absence from elite European competition is its potential to scupper what had until last summer seemed like an irresistible momentum propelling this club forwards. Even now, in a season in which the title has been surrendered to Liverpool, Manchester City are Champions League favourites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of revenue will be a blow, further compromising the club while they are under such scrutiny. But the real concern is that the ban - which City have vowed to contest with an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport - undermines the project at a time when there was already the need for sharper focus on the next phase of the challenge ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City have seen what can happen when a big club loses an iconic manager, and speculation had already begun about what life would be like without Pep Guardiola. He has one full season left on his contract and insisted just last month that he is “100 per cent” staying at the club next season. Beyond that? Of that there were no certainties and this only adds to the doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I work with them and have known them for a long time. I trust them a lot,” said Guardiola when the case was formally opened by UEFA in March. Will this ruling shake that trust or strengthen those bonds? Perhaps a siege mentality will set in. What is certain is that City will be anxious for Guardiola to oversee the rebuild that now looks necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Kompany has long gone, but he has not been replaced and further problems lie ahead. Fernandinho may have signed a new deal, but he is 35 in May. David Silva is on his way in the summer but Phil Foden, with just two Premier League starts so far this season, has not been trusted to take the mantle of Manchester City playmaker as had been expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Sergio Aguero, still in such rich form, turns 32 in June and is likely to have only one full season left as a City player. Will Gabriel Jesus really be given the opportunity to replace him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This UEFA ruling puts the focus not merely on those at the beginning and end of their Manchester City careers but the spotlight will fall too on those who are in their prime. Because it is a prime that could now find itself compromised by this punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, the thought of spending their best years outside of Champions League competition will be a worry. They have both won the Premier League more than once already. It is the Champions League prize that could prove career-defining. Now they risk not even having the opportunity to compete for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money talks and Manchester City contracts are lucrative. Key players such as Aymeric Laporte, Ederson and Bernardo Silva are tied down for another five years, but it would be naïve for City supporters to think that conversations will not be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as City launch their appeal, player representatives will be duty bound to plot possible exit strategies. Outwardly, expect unity and talk of togetherness. Behind the scenes, uncertainty would be understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an unprecedented situation for Manchester City in the modern era. One of the features of their success over the past decade has been the ability to create their own stars and then convince them to stay at the club. A decade of Silva. Nine years of Aguero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool could not keep Luis Suarez. Chelsea had to let Eden Hazard leave. Even Manchester United were forced to allow Cristiano Ronaldo to move on in the end. But City has not been a place where players have passed through. Dreams have been fulfilled here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That becomes harder now and it does so at a time when there is an onus on Guardiola, for the first time in his managerial career, to construct a second great side in the same location as the first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a trick, perhaps the only trick, he is yet to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardiola built a wonderful team at Barcelona, of course, and tweaked the tactics throughout his four years there. The style evolved, just as it did at Bayern Munich where he achieved the feat of winning the title even better than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once his ideas had taken root, there was no great overhaul of personnel. He simply was not there long enough for that to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different. As Guardiola makes the preparation for a fifth season in the same role for the first time, the job requires ripping up some of what he himself had put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just about moving on from Kompany and Silva but asking difficult question of his own signings. Whether Benjamin Mendy can be relied upon and whether his relationship with Leroy Sane can be salvaged. Whether it is time to abandon the John Stones project and whether Kyle Walker, 30 in May, will need to adapt his game at full-back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only team among last season’s top eight to have a higher average age than Manchester City last season was Chelsea. They promptly began their own rebuild this season but City delayed theirs. Only Burnley, Watford and Crystal Palace have given fewer minutes to players currently under the age of 25 than Guardiola’s Manchester City this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major changes were already inevitable but finding someone capable of reproducing Aguero’s goal haul is unlikely to come cheap and the challenge of finding ready-made replacements for world-class performers will be even more difficult now. Champions League football is not a prerequisite for signing quality but it does make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is a task that Manchester City have accomplished before and there is a danger too in overstating the problems that they will now face. The finance is still there, the infrastructure is in place, and few would be too surprised if Real Madrid are seen off over two legs of Champions League knockout competition over the next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect Manchester City’s fans to make their feelings about UEFA crystal clear, particularly when they dare to blare out the Champions League anthem before the second leg at the Etihad Stadium. The mood among the fans is likely to be one of good riddance to European competition as they rail against the perceived unfairness of their punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whether the club’s manager and his players - both current and prospective - take the same view regarding the importance of club football’s biggest prize remains to be seen. Manchester City will respond through the courts. But it is how they respond within the dressing room and in their recruitment strategy that could define the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The immediate concern for Manchester City is missing out on Champions League football.

&lt;p&gt;And it appears his devastating goalscoring form has convinced the Premier League leaders to bring him to Anfield this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Germany international, who turns 24 in March, currently has a release clause in his contract which means he can join another club for €58 million (£48m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to sports journalist Nicolo Schira, that clause expires in April and Liverpool are now in discussions with Leipzig to get a deal wrapped up before that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelsea and Bayern Munich were also linked with Werner, who has developed into one of the most dangerous hitmen in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it appears Liverpool’s strong relationship with Leipzig and their sister club Red Bull Salzburg, having signed Naby Keita from Germany and Takumi Minamino from the Austrian side in recent windows, has seen them come up trumps again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Werner was widely expected to leave Leipzig at the end of the season and even indicated in a recent interview that he was keen on a move to the Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to German newspaper Kicker earlier in February, the striker said: “What do you say if a club comes knocking in the next two weeks, a club which is one of the favourites to win the Champions League and makes an incredible offer? Most likely every player would think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can generally imagine playing abroad one day. I am open for everything. I was over in America for a holiday recently and English football was on all of the time. That’s an exclamation mark for the Premier League.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Liverpool fans may question how the young forward would fit into their team and into Jurgen Klopp’s system, which doesn’t focus on a lone frontman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roberto Firmino has been hailed for his role in this unstoppable Reds side. Rather than spearheading their attack, the Brazilian often drops into deeper positions and helps to link play from the midfield to his wide team-mates Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But European football expert Kevin Hatchard recently told talkSPORT why that makes Werner such a great fit for Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Timo Werner is vastly experienced already and is improving all the time, he’s in his early to mid-20’s and has played over 200 games in the Bundesliga,” he told Hawksbee and Jacobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think he has really benefited from playing under [Leipzig boss] Julien Nagelsmann because he played as an out-and-out striker for pretty much his whole career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nagelsmann has said to him, ‘Look I think you can be much more dangerous playing from a deeper role’. So he has almost been playing as an attacking midfielder at times – kind of driving past defences with his pace.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is said to be a long-term admirer of the 23-year-old German striker, who has been absolutely on fire this season with 25 goals and 10 assists for the Bundesliga club.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/werner.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/werner.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Barca edge out Getafe to move level with Real at top of La Liga</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/barca" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Barca edge out Getafe to move level with Real at top of La Liga" /><published>2020-02-15T16:33:19+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-15T16:33:19+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/barca</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/barca">&lt;p&gt;Barcelona went level on points with La Liga leaders Real Madrid after grinding out a narrow win over Getafe.
Allan Nyom appeared to put third-placed Getafe ahead but his goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee for a foul on Samuel Umtiti. Antoine Griezmann clipped Barca ahead from Lionel Messi’s excellent first-time pass and Sergi Roberto scored their second from Junior Firpo’s cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Angel Rodriguez’s volley set up a tense finale. The 32-year-old, who Barcelona are considering signing in an emergency deal, guided home an expert finish from 18 yards out from Jaime Mata’s cross. That was his eighth goal as a substitute this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getafe almost rescued a point but Marc-Andre ter Stegen’s excellent save denied Angel a second. Under La Liga rules, if a player is out for more than five months, then clubs can apply to sign one player from another La Liga club. With Ousmane Dembele ruled out for up to six months - and Luis Suarez also sidelined - Barca are looking at several options, including Angel, who has a £7.5m buyout clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messi has now failed to score in four consecutive La Liga appearances for the first time since October 2013 to January 2014 - although he had set up Barca’s previous six league goals before Roberto’s strike.&lt;/p&gt;
