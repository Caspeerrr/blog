AZ Alkmaar’s title chances took a blow as they were defeated 2-0 at FC Twente.

AZ went into the game looking to bounce back after their shock KNVB Cup loss at home to NAC Breda in midweek.However, Arne Slot’s side were second best from the start and were unlucky not to be behind in the fourth minute when Noa Lang smashed the crossbar.

In the 25th minute, it was 1-0 for the Tukkers after Giorgi Aburjania’s free-kick left Marco Bizot with no chance. Five minutes later, it was 2-0 when Queensy Menig punished Teun Koomeiners for losing the ball in midfield.

In the second half, AZ couldn’t mount a comeback as Twente comfortably saw out the victory. AZ must now recover ahead of their Europa League clash with LASK Linz on Thursday. Twente climbs to 12th.
